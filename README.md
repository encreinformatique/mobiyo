# Mobiyo library

This library allows the use of composer and project management dependencies.
 
We needed a proper code that can be shared easily between our projects instead of the example code of Mobiyo.

## Installation

This library is not on Packagist yet.

### Step 1

Add the package using composer.

```composer require encreinformatique/mobiyo```
